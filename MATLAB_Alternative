You can use GNU Octave program in lieu of MATLAB. 
GNU octave is free and the GUI is similar to octave but there is also a neat Command window feature you can use for shorthand.
The syntax, while having minor differences is very similar to Matlab. 

Linux and Windows compatiable!

Packages are equivilant to MATLAB add on packages. 

Packages can be accessed here: https://octave.sourceforge.io/packages.php
  to download and install packages, 
  
    type in OCTAVE:
  
    >> pkg install -forge package_name
    >> pkg load package_name
    
You might find that the MATLAB in the lab does not have the packages you need, so this is a useful alternative.    
    
    
Two packages might be of interest

    Syntax has mild diffeences between Octave and Matlab.
    
    Off the top of my head;
    1.    % is used to comment in Matlab (%% is used to create a new section in Matlab)
          %% is used to comment in Octave
